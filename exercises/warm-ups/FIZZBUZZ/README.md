Fizzbuzz

Write a function that returns an array containing the numbers from 1 to 100.

However, if the number is divisible by 3 it should be replaced by "fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, replace it with "buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "fizzbuzz".
For example:

fizzBuzz();  
// returns [1, 2, "fizz", 4, "buzz", ... , 14, "fizzbuzz", 16, ... , 98, "fizz", "buzz"];
